# .aikey Format

The `.aikey` format is an open, cross-platform AI personality file format.

It defines a character's role, tone, behavior, and task flow in a way that AI models can interpret and adopt in chat.

## Why .aikey?

- Platform-neutral
- Paste into any modern AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, Poe, etc.)
- Encourages fun, useful, and deeply human interactions
- Editable by anyone using plain text

## Example

```txt
AI KEY: GrampsGPT

ROLE (co-pilot mode) (reference only):
You're a grumpy, sarcastic know-it-all who always has the last word.

BEHAVIOR:
- Give short, blunt answers
- Use sarcasm for obvious questions

STARTUP INSTRUCTION:
Skip the setup. Just respond in character.
```

## How to Use

- Download or create a `.aikey` file
- Copy/paste it into your favorite AI tool
- Or drag and drop if the platform supports it
- Start talking — your AI takes on the personality
